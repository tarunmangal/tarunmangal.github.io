# The 5th Dimension
---
I’m not a religious person and I often find it amusing how some people put their blind faith into another human (God-man) because of this God-man performed a miracle on them or someone they know. More often than not, especially in case of Rishis and sages they would perform a miracle wherein they will recite some really peculiar incident from one’s past. I have never personally experienced it but I have heard about such incidents. And I've often dismissed this very idea to be true. I always feel that there is an ulterior motive to all this and people are just cooking up stories to recruite more people to their commune.   

But recently it occurred to me that there is a chance that there might be something there. That, there may be some sliver to truth to this. We know that we humans live in a 4 dimensional world, the 3D Space and Time. In this 4D world we can move freely up down, right left; ie we can move freely in the 3D space. But the 4th dimension of Time is inaccessible. It only goes in one direction and we have no control over it. Now imagine, if we were a 5 dimensional being, we will be able to move back and forth in the Time dimension too.  One way to visualise is to imagine someone recording your life on a film tape. Just like in case of a movie tape one can go back and forth to see what was one doing at a given moment in time in the past. A 5 dimensional being can move back and forth across this deck of snapshots. The best visualisation of this is something that was shown the end scenes of the movie **Interstellar**.  

BTW, what is Time anyways? In modern physics there is no real concept of time (at least that is what I have understood). If there was no heat, one cannot define Time. Let me explain with an example. If there is a pendulum which is not loosing its energy in the form of heat, it will be impossible for an observer to tell when it started and when it will end. Every oscillation is exactly the same as the last one. The same event is happening again and again in a loop. Instead, if there is loss of energy due to heat the observer can accurately pinpoint the beginning and the end as every oscillation will be different from the previous ones. That is Time. In the quantum realm there is no real concept of time. Once you are beyond the event horizon, one can technically go back and forth in time.

Coming back to the point. one of the concepts that is talked about in Hinduism is the concept of Maya. Maya is like a screen that has been put-up in front of our senses. We interact with it on a daily basis using our senses and that is where we lead over life. It is like our real self has been trapped. As per Hinduism, the real purpose of life is to lift this veil and seek the truth that lives beyond Maya. Now why the Truth is hiding from us is not very clear to me. However, I understand the abstract concept. The lure of Maya is so much that most of us, like 99.9999999% of us, are unable to unhinge ourselves from it and look beyond. But, what if some of us can. We often hear that Rishis go into Smaadhi for days together. It appears as if in their mind they have gone beyond the here and now. What if, these sages are able to enter the 5th dimension in which they can easily travel back and forth the 4 dimensions. 

This idea is fascinating to me. I don’t believe in the idea of miracles or God-men. But somehow with my limited understanding of these concepts and very limited knowledge  of modern day Physics this seems like a real possibility. The sub-continent unlike today, was a prosperous land and land of excess. When one lives in such a society one’s mind is free of all the daily troubles that keeps one tied to reality’s cycle of happiness and sorrow. It is then implied, that there is quite a possibility that our ancestors were able to access the world beyond the 4 dimensions. The way they describe the concept of Maya and how they are able to accurately depict someone’s past and that the absolution lies when one is able to break through the force of Maya now sits well into my mind’s mould. I think there is value in understanding these concepts more. Even though every time I have tried learning about it, all I find are inferences and no background or explanation other than some abstract ideas. You would often hear the God-mean say that it is all about believing as this is something that is beyond what our senses can reason, observe or measure and hence unreasonable. I find this statement repulsive as for one, it doesn’t challenge me, it only asks me to submit. It doesn’t allow for doubt and intrigue. And second, I have seen too many bad actors taking advantage of  innocent people. 

Nevertheless, this is where I am. I think there is value in exploring this idea more.
